        <p>Buggy is a software application that keeps track of locally reported software bugs in software development projects. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system.

,it allows end-users to enter bug reports directly. It could  only be used internally in a company or organization doing software development. As Software development roadmap it can be integrated with other project management software.

A bug tracking system is usually a necessary component of a professional software development infrastructure, and consistent use of a bug or issue tracking system is considered one of the "hallmarks of a good software team.
<h5>Usage</h5>
A major component of a bug tracking system is a database that records facts about known bugs. Facts may include the time a bug was reported, its severity, the erroneous program behavior, and details on how to reproduce the bug; as well as the identity of the person who reported it and any programmers who may be working on fixing it.

Typical bug tracking systems support the concept of the life cycle for a bug which is tracked through the status assigned to the bug. It allows administrators to configure permissions based on status, move the bug to another status, or delete the bug. The system should also allow administrators to configure the bug statuses and to what extent a bug in a particular status can be moved.
Some systems will e-mail interested parties, such as the submitter and assigned programmers, when new records are added or the status changes.</p>
<h5>Future Realease</h5>
<p>It is possible to perform automated diagnosis based on the content of the bug report. For instance, one can do automated detection of bug duplicates or automatic bug fixing.</p>
